Re-do media, it's shit (Need to re-do provider to save media not files)
Go through all TODO comments and try to fix all warnings
Update ReadMe and add docs (How do other sites do it?)
Build Starter site and record video (How deal with test media in repo so users can see it?)

### Videos to do
Add TinyMCE editor - Need to think where to store the API key globally? Add settings and make settings UI uniform
Settings on RTE (Check Umbraco) also ChatGPT add in and media picker add in
.. Or have ChatGPT property editor

### Alpha Release TODO

URls - use the path to create the url? so the url reflects where the item is, make this optional/configurable
EF Core Query Caching? (https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Plus.EFCore/) Does this auto clear?
look into how to ship with different migrations based on Db and apply as and when
Find someone to help with the nuget packaging. Need to install site, but have Components/Core as separate nuget package that people reference in other projects
Go through TODO comments left
