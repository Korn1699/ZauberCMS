# ZauberCMS - A Blazor CMS (Inspired By Umbraco)

### Important! This project is a proof of concept and still a work in progress

ZauberCMS is a CMS built on Blazor. The admin is built in Blazor InteractiveServer (Majority of the admin components are using Razden components) and 
the front end (Your site/content) can be built in whatever you want, static, server, WASM. The CMS is inspired by Umbraco, and follows many of the 
same concepts.

I wanted a CMS that was aimed towards .Net Developers who wanted to use Blazor and also a CMS that is easily extendable and customisable without 
having to learn a front end framework.

_Core tech used is: .Net 8, Blazor, EF Core, Identity, Mediatr, Radzen Components_

The video below shows the starter site being built. It covers building a site from nothing, to complete finished site. If you have never used Umbraco 
then I highly recommend watching it.

### Full Starter Site Build Video Coming Soon
