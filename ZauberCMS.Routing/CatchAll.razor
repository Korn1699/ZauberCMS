        This page is the final catch all for any routes that are not hard coded
        usually these are the front end pages which are then fetched from the DB
        this single page is in the project, because how the Blazor routing works
        I need to pass this assembly in last so it loads all routes from all 
        other assemblies first, making this the fall back and so it doesn't interfere
        or intercept routes that is should not
